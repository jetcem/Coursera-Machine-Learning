#Coursera-Machine Learning (Andrew N.G.)

This repo includes all programming assignments from Coursera's Machine Learning course.
Course exercises are done in octave, in addition to this, some of the algorithms are coded in python environment to get some practice in python.

##Octave:
Week_2  : Programming Exercise 1: Linear Regression

Week_3  : Programming Exercise 2: Logistic Regression

Week_4  : Programming Exercise 3: Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks

Week_5  : Programming Exercise 4: Neural Networks Learning

Week_6  : Programming Exercise 5: Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance
